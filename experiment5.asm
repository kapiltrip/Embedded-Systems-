; Experiment 5 â€“ Count number of 1s and 0s in a byte.
; Instructions explained:
;   LDR/LDRB - fetch the byte and read it into a register.
;   MOV      - initialize counters for ones, zeros, and bit iterations.
;   RRX      - rotate right through carry; LSB moves into C flag.
;   ADDCS    - add when carry set (bit was 1).
;   ADDCC    - add when carry clear (bit was 0).
;   SUBS     - decrement loop counter and set flags.
;   BNE      - repeat while not finished.
;   ADD      - sum ones and zeros for verification.
;   CMP      - compare sum with expected total.
;   MOVEQ/MOVNE - set pass flag based on comparison result.
;   STR      - store computed counts and result.
;   B        - infinite loop at program end.
