; Experiment 4 â€“ Count how many bytes equal 0xAC in a memory block.
; Instructions explained:
;   LDR   - loads base addresses for data and storage locations.
;   MOV   - initializes loop counters and accumulators.
;   LDRB  - reads a single byte from memory and post-increments the pointer.
;   CMP   - compares byte to constant, updating condition flags.
;   ADDEQ - adds one to the count when Z flag indicates equality.
;   SUBS  - decrements remaining byte count and updates flags.
;   BNE   - repeats loop while bytes remain.
;   STR   - stores the final count to memory.
;   B     - loops forever at program end.
