; Experiment 10 â€“ Count occurrences of a letter in a string.
; Instructions explained:
;   LDR   - obtains pointer to string and storage area.
;   MOV   - initializes counter and target character.
;   LDRB  - reads characters one byte at a time with post-increment.
;   CMP   - checks for string terminator and compares characters.
;   BEQ   - exits loop when null terminator reached.
;   ADDEQ - increments count when character matches target.
;   B     - loops until end and halts afterwards.
;   STR   - stores final count.
