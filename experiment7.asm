; Experiment 7 â€“ Division using repeated subtraction.
; Instructions explained:
;   LDR   - retrieve dividend, divisor, and storage addresses.
;   MOV   - clear quotient accumulator.
;   CMP   - compare values to control loops and detect division by zero.
;   BEQ   - branch to done when divisor is zero to avoid division.
;   BLT   - exit loop when dividend becomes less than divisor.
;   SUB   - subtract divisor from dividend each iteration.
;   ADD   - increment quotient after each successful subtraction.
;   STR   - store quotient and remainder.
;   B     - loop for both the division process and the final halt.
