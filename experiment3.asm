; Experiment 3 â€“ Copy blocks of memory using multiple transfer and looped single transfers.
; Instructions explained:
;   LDR    - obtains addresses or data words from memory.
;   LDMIA  - loads multiple registers sequentially, auto-incrementing the address.
;   STMIA  - stores multiple registers sequentially, also auto-incrementing.
;   MOV    - sets up loop counters.
;   LDR/STR with post-index - move one word at a time while advancing pointers.
;   SUBS   - subtracts and sets flags for loop termination.
;   BNE    - branches when Z flag is clear to continue looping.
;   B      - halts execution by looping to itself.
